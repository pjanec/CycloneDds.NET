## Summary

Topic Explorer, Topic Picker, and Column Picker were implemented with unit tests, but DMON-017 manual verification is incomplete.

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Manual DMON-017 verification incomplete

**File:** `.dev-workstream/reports/MON-BATCH-09-REPORT.md`  
**Problem:** Manual checks for z-order and close behavior were not executed. DMON-017 requires these checks.  
**Fix:** Run the missing manual checks and update the batch report with results (z-order, close).

## Verdict

**Status:** NEEDS FIXES

**Required Actions:**
1. Execute and document remaining DMON-017 manual checks in the report.
