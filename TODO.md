[TODO] Upgrade to cyclone dds 11.0.

[TODO] Remove cyclone dds cxx submodule, not used fo arnything.

[IMPROVEMENT] CodeGen runs on every build, slowing down unit testing etc. Better if it runs only on change, i.e. if sources are newer than generated files.

[IMPROVEMENT] There might be just one generated cs file per dds struct, combining view, serializers etc. Nice to have. Low priority.
